# OctoPrint-Themeify

A small [OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint) plugin to change the looks of OctoPrint!
Currently features a beautiful Dark Theme inspired by Discord's color [palette](https://discordapp.com/branding), along with a light Material Design theme. 

Also features customization of individual elements. With the advanced-customization scheme you can modify the appearance to your heart's desire directly from the settings-dialog!

Pull requests for new CSS-themes are appreciated!
